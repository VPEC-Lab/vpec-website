Lili Hauser is a first-year graduate student in the Affective, Social, and Cognitive (ASC) Psychology program. She is interested in visual short term-memory, certain types of visual masking, and how we become aware of our visual world. She is currently working on an ongoing project on redundancy masking (check out Sayim & Taylor, 2019 for the OG). Outside of the lab, she likes knitting, walking around, programming games, and hanging out with her cats.
