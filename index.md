# Visual Perception, Emotion & Cognition Laboratory

Our primary goal is to understand how basic neural and cognitive mechanisms shape what people see and hear. We employ psychophysics and modeling to understand how basic visual processes allow people to see and understand both simple and complex patterns like shapes, facial expressions and gaze. Our goal is to use vision science to answer core questions about the human mind and the nature of visual awareness while making an impact on multiple disciplines within psychology. We also collaborate to examine the role of perceptual processes in clinical, affective and social outcomes.


The VPEC Lab is part of the [Affective, Social, and Cognitive Area](https://liberalarts.du.edu/academics-admissions/programs-gr/phd-affective-social-cognitive-psychology) in the [Department of Psychology](https://liberalarts.du.edu/psychology) at the [University of Denver](https://www.du.edu/). We operate with the support of the NSF (Award 2141313) and the NIH (Award R15HD108690).
