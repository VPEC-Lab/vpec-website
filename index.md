# Visual Perception, Emotion & Cognition Laboratory

Our primary goal is to understand how basic neural and cognitive mechanisms shape what people see and hear. We employ psychophysics and modeling to understand how basic visual processes allow people to see and understand both simple and complex patterns like shapes, facial expressions and gaze. Our goal is to use vision science to answer core questions about the human mind and the nature of visual awareness while making an impact on multiple disciplines within psychology. We also collaborate to examine the role of perceptual processes in clinical, affective and social outcomes.
