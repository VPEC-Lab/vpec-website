The VPEC Lab gives demonstrations of vision science to elementary, middle-school and high-school students. Our director, lab members and a team of graduate student volunteers from the University of Denver will visit your school and present hands-on, cutting-edge demonstrations of visual illusions and neuroscience research.

The purpose of this outreach program is not just to entertain, but also to stimulate scientific curiosity, especially among science-averse students, showing them that their curiosities and interests are not only shared by scientists, but are scientific in nature.

We'll help your students to understand fascinating discoveries without being overly technical, highlighting that much of perception is rooted in the activity of the brain, not just the eyes.
