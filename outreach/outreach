The VPEC Lab gives demonstrations of vision science to elementary, middle-school and high-school students. Our director, lab members and a team of graduate student volunteers from the University of Denver will visit your school and present hands-on, cutting-edge demonstrations of visual illusions and neuroscience research.

The purpose of this outreach program is not just to entertain, but also to stimulate scientific curiosity, especially among science-averse students, showing them that their curiosities and interests are not only shared by scientists, but are scientific in nature.
